# Image-Captioning-using-KNN
Implement an image captioning system with KNN and query expansion on MS COCO 2014, using CLIP embeddings and Faiss for efficient similarity search. Performance is evaluated with BLEU scores, optimizing k and Faiss parameters. Includes a qualitative analysis through caption visualizations.
